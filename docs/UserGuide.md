# User Guide
**CinternS** is a **desktop app for managing internship applications, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, **CinternS** can get your internship application management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. It consists of several useful features which the users are able to execute using commands.

5. Type the command into the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`list`** and pressing Enter will display the applications currently in **CinternS**.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`list`** : Displays internship application.

    * **`add`**`c/ABC Company d/01/01/2022 p/Software Engineer` : Adds an internship application on `01/01/2022` to company `ABC` for the role of `Software Engineer` to **CinternS**.

    * **`delete`**`2` : Deletes the 2nd application shown in the current list.

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add c/COMPANY_NAME`, `COMPANY_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/Google`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `d/DATE p/POSITION`, `p/POSITION d/DATE` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
