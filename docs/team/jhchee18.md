### Project: CinternS

CinternS is a desktop app for managing internship applications, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Include Interview as one of the fields of Application.
    * What it does: Interview contains its own fields, including Round, InterviewDate, InterviewTime and Location. All of them which in turns are included into a separated list to be displayed on the UI.
    * Justification:  This allows the user to have a quick and clear glance at his / her past and future interviews so that the user can better manage his / her internship applications.
    * Highlights: This enhancement provides two additional commands:
      1. `AddInterviewCommand`: Allows user to add new interview to existing application.
      2. `RemoveInterviewCommand`: Allows user to remove existing interview from application.
      <br>This enhancement acts as the backbone of other newly implemented features, e.g. `Sort`, `Remind`, `Archive`, etc. It also involves every component of the App to implement this feature, hence complete understanding of the components is necessary.
